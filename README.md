## Model dtx files for LaTeX package and class writers

`demopkg.dtx` and `democls.dtx` are based on [Joseph Wright's model `dtx`
file](http://www.texdev.net/2009/10/06/a-model-dtx-file/) with some
modifications made to suit my tastes. In particular, I find it helpful to
include detailed installation instructions by default, to use the `gitinfo2`
package, and to generally package things with GitHub distribution in mind. For
further reference on the use of these files, refer to their respective
`README`s.
